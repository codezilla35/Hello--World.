# Hello--World.

Whats up good people!

Codezilla35 here and I am new to not only the coding community but to github as well.
I am teaching myself to be very fluent in the python language right now, but I plan on 
moving over to java an java script.  While doing python im also teach myself SQL and HTML too.
My goal is to be a jack of all trades in coding as to not be limited in just any niche.
